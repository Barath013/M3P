# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x=('barath','N',8,'hello',6.59)
if 'n' in x:
    print("'n' exists within the tuple")
else:
    print("'n' does not exists within the tuple")
if 8 in x:
    print("'8' exists within the tuple")
else:
    print("'8' does not exists within the tuple")
```
## Output

## Result
The Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple is executted successfully
